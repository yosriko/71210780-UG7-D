bad guy - Billie Eilish

White shirt now red, my boloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal

Bruises on both my knees for you 
Don't say thank you or please 
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy 
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type

Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
